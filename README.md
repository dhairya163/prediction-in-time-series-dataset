# Objective-
To perform predictions of 10th year Parameter 9-13 from the given dataset for every Section by using previous 9 years. There are total of 101 Sections.

# Models used-
3 Models were tested. (GradientBoostingRegressor , ElasticNet , AdaBoost)

Total RMSE values of all 3 models - 

AdaBoost Gives RMSE = 42.72 

ElasticNet Gives RMSE = 85.30

GradientBoostingRegressor Gives RMSE = 39.31

#### Since GradientBoostingRegressor gave the lowest RMSE , it was used to predict the parameters for 10th year.

##### Individual and combined RMSE has also been calculated along with comparison plots.
